# Set 2

 This is the first of several sets on block cipher cryptography. This is bread-and-butter crypto, the kind you'll see implemented in most web software that does crypto.

This set is relatively easy. People that clear set 1 tend to clear set 2 somewhat quickly.

Three of the challenges in this set are extremely valuable in breaking real-world crypto; one allows you to decrypt messages encrypted in the default mode of AES, and the other two allow you to rewrite messages encrypted in the most popular modes of AES. 

 - Implement PKCS#7 padding
 - Implement CBC mode
 - An ECB/CBC detection oracle
 - Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Simple)
 - ECB cut-and-paste
 - Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Harder)
 - PKCS#7 padding validation
 - CBC bitflipping attacks

## Implement PKCS#7 padding

A block cipher transforms a fixed-sized block (usually 8 or 16 bytes) of plaintext into ciphertext. But we almost never want to transform a single block; we encrypt irregularly-sized messages.

One way we account for irregularly-sized messages is by padding, creating a plaintext that is an even multiple of the blocksize. The most popular padding scheme is called PKCS#7.

So: pad any block to a specific block length, by appending the number of bytes of padding to the end of the block. For instance,

"YELLOW SUBMARINE"

... padded to 20 bytes would be:

"YELLOW SUBMARINE\x04\x04\x04\x04"

## Implement CBC mode

CBC mode is a block cipher mode that allows us to encrypt irregularly-sized messages, despite the fact that a block cipher natively only transforms individual blocks.

In CBC mode, each ciphertext block is added to the next plaintext block before the next call to the cipher core.

The first plaintext block, which has no associated previous ciphertext block, is added to a "fake 0th ciphertext block" called the initialization vector, or IV.

Implement CBC mode by hand by taking the ECB function you wrote earlier, making it encrypt instead of decrypt (verify this by decrypting whatever you encrypt to test), and using your XOR function from the previous exercise to combine them.

[The file here](data/10.txt) is intelligible (somewhat) when CBC decrypted against "YELLOW SUBMARINE" with an IV of all ASCII 0 (\x00\x00\x00 &c)
Don't cheat.

Do not use OpenSSL's CBC code to do CBC mode, even to verify your results. What's the point of even doing this stuff if you aren't going to learn from it?
